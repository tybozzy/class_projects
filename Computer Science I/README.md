# Computer Science I

**All projects created in the Fall 2022 semester*

This class was an introduction to computer science, Java, and object-oriented programming. It was my first foray into Java and propelled me to an intermediate/advanced knowledge of the language.

*Note: The import of these files was a little sloppy and there may be some code errors that did not exist at creation. There also may be some weird code thanks to the way in which this class was taught. There also may be some complementary code written by instructors that is necessary for my code to run.*
