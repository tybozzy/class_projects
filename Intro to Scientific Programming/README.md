# Introduction to Scientific Programming

**All projects created in the Spring 2022 semester*

While I was mostly self-taught before, this was my in-depth instruction in Python during my first semester at university. The focus of this class was utilizing Python for data science purposes and becoming more familiar with the language. Thanks to what I learned in this class, I continued using Python and it quickly became my favorite language.

## Personal Favorites:
